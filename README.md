# Dukaan

This application is created using React alongside Webpack as bundling tool and babel as the transpiler. 

## Features 

* Use of Webpack & Babel to boost development & production build times
* Obsfucated classNames using Webpack - this makes use of a source map to link the corresponding classes and thus, reduce the bundle size by a great margin. 
* Used `source-map` & `inline-source-maps` for facilitating efficient debugging on development and production environments respectively. 
* Splitted larger JS bundle files into multiple chunks to enhance production build performances. 
* Made use of CSS minifiers and Terser plugin to uglify CSS & JavaScript to reduce the overall bundle size.
